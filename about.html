<div class="cont">
<P class="address">
The effects of domestic violence are devastating, widespread and seep into all corners of our society. At the moment, at least one in six women and one in twenty men have experienced domestic violence by an intimate partner that they may or may not have been living with. Around 30% of homicide offences and 33% of sexual assaults are related to family and domestic violence. However it is important to understand that domestic violence is preventable. This involves supporting victims of abuse, condemning violence and cultural change.<br> </P>

<div class="cont">
<P class="address">
DVNSW is an independent, representative body that works with 50 other organisations in NSW. Our goal is to raise awareness and to create a community where we can support and assist the victims and survivors of domestic violence whether they are a male, female, or a child. We work hard to support primary prevention and early intervention work as well as provide training and sector information to our members. Ultimately, the goal of DVNSW is to eliminate DFV through leadership in advocacy, partnerships and promotion of good practice.
